# PianoHero

Inspired by my passion for music and coding, as well as my desire to learn piano, I created an application which allows users to visualize the keys played on the piano. 

As of this moment, users can load any midi file, and use the application to play the midi file, and see the piano keys visually on their screen. The program is generalized to accept any midi files, and will successfully play each note. Within my create song environment, users can select a midi input of their own, and visually see the keys they play in real time. 

I am currently developing code which will enable users to record their real time input and save the input as midi files. The program can then play those files back to them, and can also be used within the main function of the game. 

The main function of the game is under development, and will allow users to play along with songs as they are being visualized, recording the accuracy of the keys pressed as well as the users strengths and weaknesses. 

The final aspect of the game that I am currently working on is the learn piano section of the game. This section is what initially sparked my idea for this application, as it is how I personally wanted to learn piano. This aspect of the application will have levels where users can learn basic notes, chords, scales, and general theory. As of today, the basic chords section has been completed. In the future, It will range from basic to advanced theory, so users of any skill can experience and enjoy my application. Not everyone interested in the piano has access to a midi keyboard, so the learn piano environment will be a hybrid environment that can be used with a midi keyboard as well as a standard computer. Since I am a beginner to the piano as well, my desire is to successfully create an environment that allows users with any amount of knowledge to efficiently master the piano in a fun and rewarding way. 

Thank you all for taking an interest in my vision.

Sincerely, 

Riley Livers
